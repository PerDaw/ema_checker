Checks for appointments at the Kieler Einwohnermeldeamt.

Its just a small script for those who are too lazy to check for appointments themselfes. (Spoiler: Like me)
This script only makes sense, because all appointments are always booked out.

In general it checks the API of the online booking tool and sends a notification for available appointments through a discord bot, so you are able to book them before anyone else!

Make sure you have those to requirements met (use pip):
  - requests
  - discord

The channel ids and bot token are stored in individual .txt files, because you should not share them. So make sure you create those yourself.

Good luck!

PS: Its developed quick and dirty while watching netflix. Should work smooth nevertheless.
